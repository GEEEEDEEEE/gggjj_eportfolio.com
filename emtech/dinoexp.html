<p>
My experience in my first year in senior high is a roller coaster ride. I able to meet new people that make my day in school. I’m able to meet new teachers that teaches me to new subjects and teaching us about the lesson of life. I’m able also to improve my academics I’m able to reach with honors this first quarter, but in result it pressured me to maintain my grades, unfortunately, in second semester I didn’t maintain my grades. But it also gives me motivation to do better, and it help me realize that sometimes you are not able to be always at top. So I’m currently working hard to make my grades up again, and to make my friends and family proud of me.
