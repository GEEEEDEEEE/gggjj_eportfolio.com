When I was in grade 11, I was nervous because I’ll be meeting new people. I’ll cope up with others again. But thankfully, many of my classmmates were boys so we enjoyed the school year. Time travels so fast, it seems like we just met yesterday but now we’re already so close to graduation day. To all my classmates, teachers and friends, thank you for the happy memories that you have given to me. To all of my teachers, thank you for the patience and things that we’ve learned from you. I promise that I’ll forget this journey with you. I love you all and cheers to the wonderful journey!
