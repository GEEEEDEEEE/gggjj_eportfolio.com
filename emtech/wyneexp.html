<p>
I met a lot of friends and sometimes there are other things that don't suit you to be friends and you don't have the same attitude but apart from that after 2 years of covid I will also experience my senior high school life even though I didn't finish my high school life I will have more fun because of my friends now and I can't stay at home anymore my friends are my second family and I'm looking forward to being with them in all the outings
