<p>
On my Senior High School Journey, I enrolled from private school. I challenged myself and I found out that this school is better because I learned a lot and I was nervous yet excited at first. But I became happy because the people are better than what I’ve expected — they treated me as a friend, a brother, and a family. We united, which I really did not expected. I enjoyed, even if it’s hard and frightening.
